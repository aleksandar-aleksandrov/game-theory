## Game Theory @ Yale [Full Course](https://oyc.yale.edu/economics/econ-159) [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6EF60E1027E1A10B)

### Lecture 1: Introduction: First Five Lessons
    - What is Game Theory?
        A method of studying strategic situations.
    - What is strategic?
        A setting, where the outcome does not depend only on you, but also on the actions of others.
    - What are the applications of Game Theory?
        Business, politics, sports, etc.
    - What are the modatilities of a game?
        Actors, Actions, Strategies, Outcomes & Payoffs.
    - What is a strictly dominating strategy?
        A strategy which produces a strictly greater payoff than another strategy regardless of what others do.
    - What is a strictly dominated strategy?
        A strategy which produces a strictly smaller payoff than another strategy regardless of what others do.
    - Lesson 1: Never play a strictly dominated strategy!
    - Lesson 2: Rational choice can lead to outcomes that suck!
    - Lesson 3: You can not get what you want unless you know what you want! (Payoffs matter. Different payoffs lead to different games.)
    - Lesson 4: Put yourself in other's shoes and try to guess what are they going to do!
    - Lesson 5: Yale students are evil! :)


### Lecture 2: Putting yourself into other people's shoes
    - What are the formal ingredients of a game?
        - Players/Actors - i, j
        - Strategies
            - si - strategy of the ith player
            - Si - set of possible strategies of the ith player
            - s - a particular play of the game (a strategy profile)
            - s-i - a choice for all except the ith player
        - Payoffs - ui(s) = ui(si, s-i) payoff for the ith player based on the plays of all actors
    - What is a weakly dominated strategy?
        - Player i's strategy si' is weekly dominated by the strategy si if
            - ui(si, s-i) >= ui(si', s-i') for all s-i
            - ui(si, s-i) > ui(si', s-i') for at least one s-i
    - Iterative deletion of dominated strategies
    - Common Knowledge - I know that you know that I know that you know ...
    - Mutual Knowledge != Common Knowledge
